## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that refactoring it's important for better solutions.

I learned that html is for structure and I need to ignore default styles that came with browser, in that in mind I forced myself to write more semantic elements and let look and feel to css and javascript.

I ALSO Notice that I experienced some struggling to find name for classes. as author garbage solution I get to use CSS selectors to manipulate elements, it's add some complexity, but I gave it a try .

```html
<ul>
  <li><a href="#"></a></li>
  <li><a href="#"></a></li>
  <li><a href="#"></a></li>
</ul>
```

```css
ul > li:nth-child(1) a {
  color: var(--Some-Color);
}
ul > li:nth-child(2) a {
  color: var(--Some-Color);
}
ul > li:nth-child(3) a {
  color: var(--Some-Color);
}
```
